            <h3>Ultima Thule</h3>
              <p>
              Ultima Thule is a location in Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker and the
              final zone visited in the expansion story. Located at the farthest
              edge of the universe, it is a domain of pure dynamis, where emotions
              dictate reality, from being able to see and breathe to moving one
              place to the next.

          <p>
            First of all you will need a timer for ten seconds and not longer. For
            this you can just use a macro. If you have these than start fisshing,
            if you get a !! bite in ten seconds than hook it otherwhile just stop
            fishing because you gonna lose your bait! Normally the !! bite almost
            all the time is a
            <a

              >Horizon Event</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you have this fish do the following skill combo in order to catch
            Phallaina:
          </p>
